Introduction
===========
I find this configuration to be very simple yet powerful. I'm trying to get VIM to be very versatile while keeping everything lightweight and easy to use. This is the configuration that I use every day at work and it works great for me. I'm always open to suggestions/contributions. Thanks for stopping by and I hopefully you'll enjoy my config.

N.B.: This read me is currently written for Mac OSX only. It should not be too complicated to install under Linux. Windows... I have no idea.

Requirements
============
There are some dependencies in order to get this configuration working properly and smoothly. Here is a list of all thirdparty libraries you will need on your computer before you can install. Please note that if you install these dependencies via Homebrew(http://brew.sh/), you will most likely have to added their locations to your PATH.

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html): Make is a family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files.

		I recommend installing CMake with Homebrew(http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

			brew install cmake

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/): A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

		I recommend install Ruby with Homebrew(http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

			brew install ruby

* [ctags](https://github.com/shawncplus/phpcomplete.vim/wiki/Patched-ctags): Follow the instructions on the Patched-ctags repository to compile it from source and get better completion for PHP.


Manual Installation
===================

1. Check out the source from github:

		git clone https://github.com/nicholasc/vim-config.git ~/.vim

2. Clone vundle repository inside the bundle folder:

		git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

3. Open vim and install the plugins using the following command:
	
		:PluginInstall

4. The last step here is to compile the vimproc extension for Vim:

		cd ~/.vim/bunder/vimproc
		make

You should be good to go now. Make sure you read the usage section to make sure you're using the full potential of this config.
