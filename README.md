Information
===========
This is a simple, yet powerfull configuration for development. I use this every day at work and it works great for me. I'm always open to suggestions/contributions or comments. Thanks & enjoy!

Manual Installation
===================

1. Check out the source from github:

	git clone git://github.com/nicholasc/vim-config.git ~/.vim

2. Open vim and install the plugins using the following command:
	
	:PluginInstall

Plugins
=======
All the plugins here are clones of their original repository. Vundle is being used as a plugin manager. To update these plugins simply use :PluginUpdate. To list them, use :PluginList.

Here is a list of all the available plugin with this config:

* [CommandT](https://github.com/wincent/Command-T): The Command-T plug-in provides an extremely fast, intuitive mechanism for
opening files and buffers with a minimal number of keystrokes.

* [Conque-Shell](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Conque-Shell): Conque is a Vim plugin which allows you to run interactive programs, such as bash on linux or powershell.exe on Windows, inside a Vim buffer.

* [grep](https://github.com/yegappan/grep): Plugin to integrate Grep search tools with Vim.


* [nerdcommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter): Vim plugin for intensely orgasmic commenting.


* [supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab): Supertab is a vim plugin which allows you to use <Tab> for all your insert completion needs 

* [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion): EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim.

* [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible): Think of sensible.vim as one step above 'nocompatible' mode: a universal set of defaults that (hopefully) everyone can agree on.
