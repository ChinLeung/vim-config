Introduction
===========
The main goal with this vim configuration is to keep things lightweight, fast and easy to use. I use it everyday both at work and at home and it works great for me. It supports Mac OS X & Windows. It will be adapted for Linux shortly. I constantly review and modifiy this configuration and I'm always open to suggestions and/or contributions.

Thanks for stopping by and hopefully you find something of use.

Requirements
============

Mac OS X:
* [MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/): MacVim must be compiled with python & lua support. Using brew, MacVim comes with python by default. We must inform brew to build the formula with lua support:

		brew install macvim --with-lua

Windows:
* [Vim for Windows](https://bitbucket.org/Haroogan/vim-for-windows/downloads): Download the version compiled with both Python and Lua.
